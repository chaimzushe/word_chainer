# Word Chain Creator  


### This is my code how i solved a famous Ruby Quiz thats one of my favorite problems.

#### This is how the challenge goes:
 Given two words of equal length as input from the user, build a chain of words connecting the first to the second. Each word in the chain must be in the dictionary and every step along the chain changes exactly one letter from the previous word.

The program asks the user for the start and target word, and produces a word chain from start to target printed to STDOUT.It prints an error message if a chain cannot be found.

### Here's an example:

start = duck

target = ruby

=> [duck, ruck, rusk, ruse, rube, ruby]
